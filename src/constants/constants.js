    title: "Face-Mask Detaction",
    description:
      "We’re living in strange times at the moment. And it seems like wearing masks in public is becoming the norm. This application can be helpful for all the shop owners, offices, banks, or any public place because if anyone is not wearing a mask then he or she must not be allowed in that area.We can integrate with CCTV and detect from their faces whether they are wearing a face mask or not. The face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset.. Since this system is just a prototype, I have an idea to fix all the bugs and release it as an open-source complete face mask detector in the future.",

    title: "Car Parking System",
    description:
      "This is car parking software.The main reason for developed this because there were large car parks near the cities but there was no monitoring system for the car park.For that reason, I developed this parking monitoring system. I created an imaginary parking spot to build this monitoring parking system. I can park 16 cars at once in this car parking park. I designed this system using a very simple UI. Because I do not want to create software that anyone can’t understands very simply. So, I designed this software that anyone can look at this and understand this monitoring software very clearly and simply. So, I can think that people (who use this monitoring system) can use it very quickly and do not fear computer knowledge.",
